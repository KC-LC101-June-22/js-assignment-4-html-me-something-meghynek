         <p>So here are a few that I've loved over the years. A post by Megan Hynek.</p>

      <h2>Louie</h2>
         <p>As a very small child, I was enamored with all animals - but especially with cats. 
         When I was about three or four, my father found a litter of abandoned kittens in backyard. He put them all in a box and showed me the babies. I was overjoyed! My dad had gotten me a <b> BOX </b> of kittens.
      Unfortunately, this was not entirely accurate. He negotiated me down from the whole box, to just one of the kittens. Not the best deal I've ever made, but hey.
   
   The kitten that I chose was white and orange. I named him Louie and I adored him. It is unfortunate that Louie did not reciprocate my feelings, but that hardly mattered to young Megan.</p>
